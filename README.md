# traditional-knowledge
With this project I want to collect all the traditional habits and knowledge that our grandparents had.

What I mean by this is simple everyday things they taught us, some are silly but I believe we should preserve them.
Some examples,
1. If you cut your finger a little, you can smash some young Gliricidia leaf buds and put it on the cut.
2. Don't drink alkaline water after eating a lot of honey. 
3. Don't go alone in deserted roads in dusk.

## What I will do
I will create a web application to store this knowledge and let users search them, improve them and add new items.
### Technical Stack
1. ReactJS - front end -> This repo
2. ExpressJS - Back end -> [Backend repo](https://github.com/sujeewasandeepa/traditional-knowledge-be)
3. PostgreSQL - Database

## How you can help
This is an opensource project. You can fork this repository and help me with development work. 
Or you can add new insights to our collection. Using the interface we have created (still not implemented).

## Why do this?
This is our traditional knowledge. I have a feeling this knowledge will be gone in a decade, if we don't preserve it. Some things like these can sound very silly, and maybe some of them are actually silly. But it is important to preserve all these this knowledge. Because there are a lot of useful knowledge as well. 
As an example,
Many years ago we went to my grandfather's brother house which was literally in the middle of a jungle. When we were playing around we found a stingless bee hive. The bees were not there for somereason, and our grandfather took the honey out and gave it to us, and he told not to drink water after eating the honey. My brother who was stubborn since he was born, ate a load of honey and drank a full glass of water. Within the next five minutes he started puking everything.

And there are a lot of this kind of knowledge assosiated with different fields as well, like agriculture. I think it's important for them to be preserved and analysed as well. Because those are the experiences of people passed from generation to generation. 
They are by no means proved to be accurate, but we can use them or may be analyze and see if they have any truth in them. May be they can be helpful to improve our modern methodologies of doing things. I believe we can get more clear use out of them after analyzing them properly. We can use scientific method.

### What is scientific method?
Simplify we can define scientific method as the process of objectively establishing facts through testing and experimentation.

The goal of this is to discover cause and effect relationships by asking questions, carefully gathering and examining the evidence, and seeing if all the available information can be combined into a logical answer.
